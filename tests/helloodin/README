Test programs for the Odin language.

Download an Odin tarball release from:

    https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/releases

Copy the contents to:

    /usr/local/odin

Add that path to PATH

    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:/sbin:/usr/local/odin/

Look at the Makefile to see how to compile/link a Odin program.

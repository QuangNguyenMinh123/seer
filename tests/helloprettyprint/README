Seer has a problem with enabling 'pretty printing' and structs have have \n characters.

    https://github.com/epasveer/seer/issues/313

    (gdb) set print pretty on

Without pretty print
    10^done,value="{B = 1, C = 0, D = \"asd\", E = std::vector<bool> of length 1, capacity 64 = {true}}"
    11^done,value="1"

With pretty print
    10^done,value="{\n  B = 1,\n  C = 0,\n  D = \"asd\",\n  E = std::vector<bool> of length 1, capacity 64 = {true}\n}"
    11^done,value="1"
